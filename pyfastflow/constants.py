"""
Global constants and configuration parameters for PyFastFlow.

This module defines compile-time constants and runtime parameters used throughout
PyFastFlow for grid dimensions, boundary conditions, hydrodynamic parameters, and
landscape evolution settings. Constants are centralized here to ensure consistency
across all GPU kernels and computational modules.

Performance Note:
Compile-time constants (marked as such) are embedded in GPU kernels during compilation
and can improve performance by up to 30% compared to runtime parameters by enabling
compiler optimizations and reducing memory accesses.

Constant Categories:
- Grid Constants: Domain size, spacing, and boundary condition modes
- Hydrodynamic Constants: Manning's roughness, precipitation, time steps
- Erosion Constants: Stream Power Law parameters, uplift, deposition
- General Constants: Physical constants (gravity, etc.)

Boundary Condition Modes:
- BOUND_MODE = 0: Open boundaries (flow can exit at all edges)
- BOUND_MODE = 1: Periodic East-West (wraps left-right borders)
- BOUND_MODE = 2: Periodic North-South (wraps top-bottom borders) 
- BOUND_MODE = 3: Custom per-node boundaries (requires boundary array)

Custom Boundary Codes (when BOUND_MODE = 3):
- 0: No Data (invalid/masked node)
- 1: Normal interior node (cannot leave domain)
- 3: Outlet node (can leave domain)
- 7: Inlet node (can only receive flow, acts normal otherwise)
- 9: Periodic connection (use with caution)

Usage:
    import pyfastflow.constants as cte
    
    # Access constants in Python code
    grid_size = cte.NX * cte.NY
    cell_area = cte.DX * cte.DX
    
    # Constants are automatically available in Taichi kernels
    @ti.kernel
    def my_kernel():
        for i in range(cte.NX * cte.NY):
            # Use constants directly
            cell_area = cte.DX ** 2
    
    # Custom boundary setup
    import numpy as np
    boundaries = np.ones((cte.NY, cte.NX), dtype=np.uint8)
    boundaries[0, :] = 3   # Top edge: outlets
    boundaries[-1, :] = 3  # Bottom edges: outlets
    cte.init_custom_boundaries(boundaries.flatten())

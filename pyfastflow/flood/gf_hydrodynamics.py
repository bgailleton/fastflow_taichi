"""
Hydrodynamic computation kernels for Flood shallow water flow.

This module implements the core hydrodynamic algorithms for 2D shallow water
flow simulation using GPU-accelerated Taichi kernels. It provides methods for
discharge diffusion and Manning's equation-based flow depth updates.

Key algorithms:
- Discharge diffusion for multiple flow path simulation
- Manning's equation for flow resistance and depth updates
- Integration with FastFlow's flow routing system

Based on methods from Gailleton et al. 2024 for efficient
shallow water flow approximation, adapted to GPU (Gailleton et al., in prep).

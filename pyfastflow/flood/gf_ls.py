"""
Flood LisFlood (LS) shallow water flow computation kernels.

Method implementation adapted from HAIL-CAESAR (https://github.com/dvalters/HAIL-CAESAR) to GPU
Method described in Bates et al. 2010: A simple inertial formulation of the shallow water equations for efficient two-dimensional flood inundation modelling

This module implements the LisFlood method for 2D shallow water flow simulation
using GPU-accelerated Taichi kernels. The LS method uses explicit time integration
with local time stepping for stability and efficiency.

Key Features:
- LisFlood time integration for shallow water equations
- Manning's friction implementation with stability checks
- Froude number limiting for numerical stability
- Discharge magnitude checks to prevent excessive flow
- 2D flow routing in both x and y directions

The implementation follows the LisFlood method principles:
1. Flow routing: Compute discharge in x and y directions
2. Depth update: Update water depths based on discharge divergence

Constants used from constants module:
- HFLOW_THRESHOLD: Minimum flow depth threshold
- EDGESW: Boundary slope for edge conditions 
- MANNING: Manning's roughness coefficient 
- NY: Number of grid rows
- NX: Number of grid columns 
- DT_HYDRO_LS: Time step for LisFlood hydro 
- GRAVITY: Gravitational acceleration 
- FROUDE_LIMIT: Maximum Froude number
